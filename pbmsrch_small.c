**        A Pratt-Boyer-Moore string search, written by Jerry Coffin
**  sometime or other in 1991.  Removed from original program, and
**  (incorrectly) rewritten for separate, generic use in early 1992.
**  Corrected with help from Thad Smith, late March and early
**  April 1992...hopefully it's correct this time. Revised by Bob Stout.
